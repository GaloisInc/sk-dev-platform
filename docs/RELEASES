To create it again after making changes:

  $ ssh -A eicadmin@sk.dev.galois.com
  $ cd sk/dev

  $ git pull # or whatever you need to do to bring the changes into
             # the repo

  $ bash dist.sh

  # At this point you might want to unpack the tarball and #
  # double-check that it includes your change(s).  If you want to
  # include a file in the distribution, check dist.sh to be sure it's
  # copied into the archive.

  $ scp separation-kernel-dev-platform.tar.gz \
      <YOU>@bootstrap.galois.com:/srv/www/bootstrap/html/sk/

Note the "<YOU>" in the last step; you'll need to 'scp' the file using
whatever account you use to connec to 'src.'  Agent forwarding (as
in'scp -A') will take care of the rest.

These steps *must* be run from a copy of the repo that has had all of
the artifacts (kernel image, buildroot filesystem) built, so that the
distribution can include the cross compilation toolchain.
