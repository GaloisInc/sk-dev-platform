	* copt.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--lenny/skeleton-make-rules--main--0.1--patch-4
		  The cross building support in Debian has been rewritten
		  to stop overriding the CC  variable to $(MAKE) in order
		  to correctly support those packages that build internal
		  tools with the native compiler during the build. This
		  means that other packages that assume that CC will be
		  overridden by the cross-compiling build scripts now fail
		  to build. The patch is simply to set CC to
		  $(DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE)-gcc only if a cross-build is
		  detected.

	* targets.mk (stamp-clean):
		  srivasta@debian.org--lenny/skeleton-make-rules--main--0.1--base-0
		  make clean not remove zero sized files. removed the part
		  that cleaned out zero sized files; since there are uses
		  for zero sized files (like, to nuke out files in
		  upstream sources and not inflate the diff. Any zero
		  sized files can still be nuked in the local.mk file.
