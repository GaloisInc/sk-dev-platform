Possible future work:
  Research
  - discuss my lobster experience/suggestions with Joe

  - understand and document all functionality provided in SELinux M4 modules.
    - coordinate with Joel(?)

  - write EDSL using CoreLob or SimpleLob as a base
  - Brad interested in dynamic policies, so separate compilation is important

  SL2CS
  - actually generate SELinux M4/Shrimp instead of homegrown M4.
    - pretty-print M4 (possibly use Magnus' M4 ast and pretty-printer)
  - integrate sl2cs into lobster (integrate lobster into sl2cs?)
  - resolve/fix limitations

  QuickCheck
  - Modify qc infrastructure so that the output of sl2cs is automatically checked against the output of lobster, and differences are reported.
  - make sure qc infrastructure is generating all the cases we are interested in.
  - fix the fixmes (currently only in the qc code)
