Strategy for generating test data:
Top Level:
  - almost always:
    2 or more classes
    2 or more new stmts
    1 or more connections
  - no ports

Inside a class:
  - almost always:
    1 or more ports
  - harder to make a sub-class as you go deeper, e.g. depth of 4 should be plenty

Overall:
  - rarely choose a string,int, or name expression
