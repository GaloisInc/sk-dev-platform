-- This is a library of parser combinators, originally written by Koen Claessen.
-- It parses all alternatives in parallel, so it never keeps hold of
-- the beginning of the input string, a common source of space leaks with
-- other parsers.  The '(+++)' choice combinator is genuinely commutative;
-- it makes no difference which branch is "shorter".
--
-- This is derived from "Text.ParserCombinators.ReadP".
-- Parameterized over the string type so that we can parse e.g.
-- bytestrings too.

The following are QuickCheck specifications of what the combinators do.
These can be seen as formal specifications of the behavior of the
