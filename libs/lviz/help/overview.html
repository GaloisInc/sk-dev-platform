<h2>Overview &amp; Goals<br>
</h2>
Many security policy languages are difficult to use because they
require programming large sets of low level rules to be
effective.&nbsp; SELinux is an example policy language which can
require 100,000's of rules to effective secure an operating
system.&nbsp;
Because of the complexity, modifying SELinux rules
to allow for any change presents a large barrier.&nbsp; Further,
programming a system composed of multiple different policy elements
with different types of rules (SELinux, Xen, guard) can be more
daunting.&nbsp; An example system might
be two SELinux servers, a virtual machine, and an external guard.<br>
<br>
The Policy DSL project goal was to provide tools and techniques to
allow for better handling of security policy creation and
analysis.&nbsp; The initial focus was to
provide tools targeted at solving SELinux configuration.&nbsp; Later
work created a more general approach to solving policy problems which
could be applied across different policy languages, including the
Lobster DSL.<br>
<br>
Lobster DSL&nbsp; is a high level policy
specification language which provides methods of abstracting,
understanding, and analyzing security policies.&nbsp; The Lobster Tool
has the ability to analyze the DSL, compile it into Shrimp DSL format
(a subset of SE Linux Native), test data flow assertion (using Symbion
extensions to the DSL), and display&nbsp; the policy graphically.<br>
<h2>Workflow and Tool Interaction<br>
</h2>
Policy DSL tools are anchored around two languages: Lobster, the
abstract DSL used to describe any policy and Shrimp DSL, which is close
to the native SELinux policy with some additional checking added.&nbsp;
The tools available are shown in Figure 1. <br>

DSL Tool Set</span></big><br>
<br>
The workflows supported by this set of tools are based around creating
and analyzing policies.&nbsp; Policies can be created at an abstract
level via Lobster and lower level polices can be generated from them.
Alternatively existing SELinux policies and be analyzed or abstracted
into Lobster.&nbsp; Some example workflows:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Creating a Lobster policy in a text file and viewing it in
LViz.&nbsp; Symbion and the compilation checking can be run from LViz</li>
  <li>Compile a Lobster policy, execute any Symbion assertions, and
generate Shrimp DSL</li>
  <li>Running genLobster to reverse compile Shrimp files into Lobster
DSL</li>
  <li>Running Shrimp tools on a policy to identify format and style
problems</li>
  <li>Viewing the Reference policy in Slide and seeing Shrimp "lint"
like problems associated with it.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tools &amp; Components</h2>
The tools and languages each have their own specific pages covering
them in more detail.&nbsp;&nbsp; Links to each tool with a short
description follows:<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="lobsterdsl.html">Lobster DSL</a> - Summary of the
Lobster Domain Specific Language used to define policies in an abstract
fashion.&nbsp; It is not tied to any specific policy languages and can
be used as the starting point for any policy definition. Compilation to
multiple policy languages is possible.<br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="symbion.html">Symbion</a> - Symbion is an extension to
the Lobster DSL language that consist of a series of assertion
statements about information flow in the policy.&nbsp; Symbion is run
as part of compilation of the policy and can be run from LViz, the
lobster policy visualization tool.</li>
  <li><a href="lviz.html">LViz</a>, - Lobster Visualization tool which
will display a lobster policy.&nbsp; Symbion checks can be viewed as
well.<br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="lobstercompiler.html">Lobster compiler</a>- Overview of
the
Lobster compiler which current converts a lobster policy into a shrimp
policy.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="shrimp.html">Shrimp&nbsp; </a>- Shrimp is a format and
tool set for analyzing SELinux policies.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="genlobster.html">GenLobster</a>, - Reverse compiler
which takes SELinux like Shrimp and converts it to Lobster<br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="slide.html">Slide</a> - Viewing tool for examining
SELinux policies while showing Shrimp "lint" like issues.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Supported Systems</h2>
Policy DSL tools were designed to operate on Linux OS, although most of
the testing has been on Ubuntu and Centos Linux.<br>
The SLIDE
program from Tresys is tested and designed around Fedora Linux because
it uses Fedora's version of Eclipse.&nbsp; <br>
<h2>Technical Papers</h2>
Multiple technical papers have been produced during the Policy DSL
project which are more detailed reference material.&nbsp; A few of the
details of the languages have been modified since the papers have been
written, but the underlying concepts are the same.&nbsp; This set of
help files provide the latest up to date syntax of the tools and
languages.<br>
The papers include:<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="Policy-DSL-HCSS-2009.pdf">Policy-DSL-2009</a> A summary
of the Policy DSL work, covering shrimp, symbion and lobster.&nbsp;
This is the most up to date paper</li>
  <li><a href="Policy-DSL-HCSS-2009-slides.pdf">Policy DSL Slides</a> -
presentation providing overview of Policy DSL work.</li>
  <li><a href="lobster.pdf">Lobster DSL paper</a> describes the lobster
generic policy language and relates it to SELinux.<br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="symbion.pdf">Symbion paper</a> describing the original
intentions of the symbion language.&nbsp; The implemented version is
slightly different than the paper and is properly described below.</li>
