<h1>Reference Policy Notes<br>
</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
The purpose of this page is to give a quick overview of the SELinux
Reference Policy flow to SELinux permission set.&nbsp; Full details of
SELinux can be found at the <a
 href="http://www.nsa.gov/research/selinux/index.shtml">NSA's SELinux
site.</a><br>
<h2>Overview<br>
</h2>
SELinux (Security Enchanced Linux) is a Linux security enforcement
mechanism which can be applied to Unix like operating
systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELinux was developed by the NSA and
released into public domain December 2000.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although SELinux
is effective in securing communications paths in a Linux system, the
rules required to lock down a complex operating system are dauntingly
large.&nbsp;&nbsp; Understanding how to modify the rules to allow for
the introduction of applications or changes to the OS is a huge
challenge.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
To address the complexity issue, Tresys modularlized the standard
policy and separated the rules into multiple different files which have
some degree of isolation from each other.&nbsp; This revised policy is
called the "Reference Policy"&nbsp; The relationship between the
Reference Policy an SELinux low level rules is illustrated in Figure 1.<br>

<br>
</span>Information flow controls are defined by defining types, then
stating allowable interactions through "allow statements". Each allow
statement defines the relationship between a subject and object node
along with the conditions of that relationship:<br>
<code style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">allow
subject_type object_type action_allowed;<br>
<br>
With types of the form </code><span
 style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">user_identity:role:type</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>

<h2>Notes</h2>
SELinux adds another layer of access control permissions on top of
standard file permission and ACLs, which are defined by the system
security policy. Every object (files and other items) ad every subject
security (process) has security context, with three attributes &#8211; a User
Identity , a role and a type. Collectively, these attributes limit the
authority of the subject over the object, Typically , the security
context is displayed as a colon-separated triplet in this format
<p>user_identity:role:type<br>
</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">When SELinux is enabled, there
are two modes:
<p>1. Permissive or 2. Enforcing</p>
<p>Permissive mode is the &#8216;warn&#8217; only mode. That is, it allows all
process access to the file system using standard DAC, but it will log
all access violations that would have been there, if SELinux has been
in the enforcing mode in /var/log/messages.</p>
<p>The Enforcing mode allows SELinux to control access to the system
using MAC, and thus enforces the SELinux policy. These modes can be
controlled dynamically using the setenforce command, and can be
permemently set in the file /etc/sysconfig/selinux<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<ul>
  <li>
    <p> <code class="command">SELINUXTYPE=<code class="option">targeted|strict</code></code>
&#8212; Specifies which policy SELinux should enforce. </p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p> <code class="option">targeted</code> &#8212; Only targeted
network daemons are protected. </p>
        <p> Policy enforcement for these daemons can be turned on or
off, using Boolean values controlled by the <span><strong
 class="application">SELinux Administration Tool</strong></span> (<code
 class="command">system-config-selinux</code>). </p>
        <p> Setting a Boolean value for a targeted daemon to <code
 class="option">0</code> (zero) disables policy transition for the
daemon. For example, you can set <code class="option">dhcpd_disable_trans</code>
to <code class="option">0</code> to prevent <code class="command">init</code>
from transitioning <code class="command">dhcpd</code> from the <span
 class="property">unconfined_t</span> domain to the domain specified in
        <code class="filename">dhcpd.te</code>. </p>
        <p> Use the <code class="command">getsebool -a</code> command
to list all SELinux booleans. The following is an example of using the <code
 class="command">setsebool</code> command to set an SELinux boolean.
The <code class="option">-P</code> option makes the change permanent.
Without this option, the boolean would be reset to <code class="option">1</code>
at reboot. </p>
        <pre class="screen">setsebool -P dhcpd_disable_trans=0<br></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> <code class="command">strict</code>
&#8212; Full SELinux protection, for all daemons. Security contexts are
defined for all subjects and objects, and every action is processed by
the policy enforcement server.<br>
