LViz Test Notes

Because LViz is a graphical file, testing has consisted of stepping through the different functions in the tool and running a number of test cases against it.

A. Testing functionality of all menu items:
Using example5.lsr, located in lobster/test/examples

1. start Lviz from the command line by doing:
lviz example5.lsr
verify that lviz starts up and loads the example.
close lviz using Menu item File/Quit

2. start lviz without any arguments.  Then try opening and closing sample lobster files
(file menu)


3. Open example5 and test View/Expand All, Collapse All from the menu.

4. Open example5.lsr and right click over domain D to collapse just that domain and then exampand it again to test localized collapse/expand.

5. example6 -  View tests.
a. select menu View/wrap and the layout should shift to vertical.
b. the select View/NoOverlap and the lines should shift from straight.
c. then select View/Curve edges to round corners
d. then select View/Lens - use up/down cursor keys to scan across domain.
e. set Edit/Lens to 29. then move cursor. Different relation between large and small shapes shoudl be observed.
f. turn off lensing.

6. Start Lviz. Select Help/Help Menu - should startup broswer (Ubuntu). Doesn't work properly for other Linux OS.
Select Help/About to see the versioning.

7. Start example28.  The colors for the layer nesting should be present, repeating every 4 layers of hierarchy.  Select Edit/Colors and adjust the level colors.
Note that 'Edge' colors is really line colors (not domain edges).
Help in this menu does not work.

B. All test cases
1. Open all all error test cases in lobster/test/examples  Each should fail with a pop up window. For symbion errors, they should show assert errors.

2. open all example#.lsr test cases to verify that they open properly and display something reasonable. Some will display symbion 'Pass' messages in the standard output.
