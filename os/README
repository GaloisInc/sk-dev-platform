Separation Kernel Operating System
==================================

This directory contains scripts to fetch and build the Linux kernel
and filesystem images necessary to run the separation kernel
development environment.

 1. Run the bootstrap script.  This will fetch the Linux kernel
    repository and buildroot package necessary to build the images.
    It will also install the necessary customized configurations for
    each component.

    os $ bash bootstrap.sh

 2. The bootstrap script will create a 'build' directory containing
    the fetched code.  Use the Makefile in the current directory to
    build it all:

    os $ make

It's always safe to run 'bootstrap.sh' again in the future, since it
will not overwrite your configs or source trees and it will update the
git repositories if they already exist.

Directories
===========

 - configs/

   Customized configurations and build scripts for some of the
   components involved, such as busybox, buildroot, and the Linux
   kernel

 - buildroot-packages/

   Custom buildroot package definitions and scripts used to build
   components needed to run the separation kernel environment, such as
   'libdl' and the customized 'schedtool' program needed for setting
   deadline scheduling parameters.
