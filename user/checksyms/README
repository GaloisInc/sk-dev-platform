This is the 'checksyms' tool, which will check the symbols used by a
binary against a whitelist with respect to a specific library.

Usage: checksyms.py <library> <whitelist> <program>

  Specify a <whitelist> of symbols defined in <library> which
  <program> should be able to link against.  Any symbols
  defined in <library> not in the <whitelist> but used by
  <program> will generate an error message.

  <whitelist> is a text file with one symbol per line.
  <library> is a C shared object.
  <program> is a compiled C program which may or may not
     link against <library>.

Example:

$ python checksyms.py /lib64/libc.so.6 libc_whitelist ../demo/disk
# Program '../demo/disk' uses the following disallowed symbols from library '/lib64/libc.so.6':
