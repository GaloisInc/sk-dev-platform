This directory contains a demonstration separation kernel application.
It shows the use of the APIs for shared memory regions, disk devices,
and communication channels.  It also includes the corresponding XML
configuration required to generate the proper C stub code and set up
shared memory and scheduling paramters.

To build the demonstration, source 'setup.sh' in this distribution and
then run

  make cross

in this directory.  The result of the build will be a filesystem
image, 'initramfs-demo', which can be combined with the pre-built
kernel image to boot the system.  For information on booting the
image, see docs/programming_guide.txt.

Demonstration Structure
-----------------------

These programs demonstrate a system with two disks and two clients
which read from one disk and write to the other.  The programs are
intended to show a separation kernel configuration with a
uni-directional data flow and access to virtual storage devices.  The
system is depicted below.

  +----------+                                   +----------+
  | Client 1 |---------------------------------->| Client 2 |
  +----------+                                   +----------+
       ^                                               |
       |                                               |
       |                                               v
   +--------+                                     +--------+
   | Disk 1 |                                     | Disk 2 |
   +--------+                                     +--------+

Disk 1 can only be accessed by Client 1.  Client 1 reads sectors from
Disk 1, transmits them to Client 2, and Client 2 writes them do Disk
2.
