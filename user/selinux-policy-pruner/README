Using this tool:

Collect a list of the types you need in a file, one per line:

types.txt:
bin_t
bsdpty_device_t
cardmgr_var_run_t
cgroup_t
checkpolicy_exec_t
...

After building your refpolicy, gather the generated base.conf and all the
*.tmp files from the tmp/ directory which are generated from the module
source files.

The tool can run in two modes: required and optional mode:
required: Only consider module dependencies which are required
optional: Consider all optional module dependencies

This is important because if you initially compiled your policy with all of
the modules you'll need to consider all of the optional sections, but you are
deciding which modules you compile from the beginning you can omit the optional
dependencies as they will be omitted if you compile fresh omitting those modules.

Execute the tool with all of these arguments.
$ selinux-policy-pruner r types.txt base.conf *.tmp
abrt
acct
ada
aide
aisexec
...

The tool will output the set of modules which are needed.

This information can inform both which modules you load at run-time using semodule
and it can inform which modules you enable in modules.conf when compiling a
policy.
